# Project: Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

## Objective:
To build a machine learning model that can predict whether a given tweet is about a real disaster (target=1) or not (target=0).

## Methodology:
We will use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) well-suited for sequence data like text.
